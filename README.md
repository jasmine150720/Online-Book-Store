## Вывод
In fact, offline book business has less revenue than online. Students need to buy comics, they usually got to the store to buy books by themselves. But for learning books or skill books for office people, parents often have the need to buy books online. Online bookstores or e-commerce websites like Ozon, Amazon, bookshop.org, etc. are chosen by customers a lot. Therefore, we can see an extremely effective form of online business, easier to reach more customers than we think.
